#Machine Learning in Context

<br />
In this course, we'll provide you with an introduction to the fantastic world of machine learning (ML). We will first help you understand the overall place of machine learning in the broader context of computer science. We'll take you through its history, perspectives, approaches, challenges, essential tools, and fundamental processes.
<br />
#Training a Model
<br />
After that, we will focus on the core machine learning process: training a model. We'll cover the entire chain of tasks, from data import, transformation, and management to training, validating, and evaluating the model.
<br />
#Foundational Concepts
<br />
Since this is an introductory course, our goal will be to give you an understanding of foundational concepts. We'll talk about the fundamentals of supervised (classification and regression) and unsupervised (clustering) approaches.
<br />
#More Advanced Techniques<br />
Then, building on these basics, we'll have a look at more advanced techniques like ensemble learning and deep learning.
<br />
#Classic Applications of ML
<br />
We'll also cover some of the best known specific applications of machine learning, like recommendations, text classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and feature learning.
<br />
#Managed Services, Cloud Computing, and Microsoft Azure<br />
Many machine learning problems involve substantial requirements—things like model management, computational resource allocation, and operationalization. Meeting all these requirements on your own can be difficult and inefficient—which is why it's often very beneficial to use Software as a Service (SaaS), managed services, and cloud computing to outsource some of the work. And that's exactly what we'll be doing in this course—specifically, we'll show you how to leverage Microsoft Azure to empower your machine learning solutions.<br />

#Responsible AI<br />
At the very end of the course, we'll talk about the broader impact of machine learning. We'll discuss some of the challenges and risks that are involved with machine learning, and then see how we can use principles of responsible artificial intelligence, such as transparency and explainability, to help ensure our machine learning applications generate positive impact, and avoid harming others.<br />
