# **Lesson Overview**<br />

In this lesson, our goal is to give you a high-level introduction to the field of machine learning, including the broader context in which this branch of computer science exists.<br />

Here are the main topics we'll cover:<br />

* What machine learning is and why it's so important in today's world
* The historical context of machine learning
* The data science process
* The types of data that machine learning deals with
* The two main perspectives in ML: the statistical perspective and the computer science perspective
* The essential tools needed for designing and training machine learning models
* The basics of Azure ML
* The distinction between models and algorithms
* The basics of a linear regression model
* The distinction between parametric vs. non-parametric functions
* The distinction between classical machine learning vs. deep learning
* The main approaches to machine learning
* The trade-offs that come up when making decisions about how to design and training machine learning models<br />

In the process, you will also train your first machine learning model using Azure Machine Learning Studio.
